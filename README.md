# Exxact Robotics - Backend Python Developer Test üõ†
Hi! We're glad you want to join Exxact Robotics! We've designed this test so that you can show us how you think about a problem and how you implement its solution. We'll discuss it during our next meeting.

## Project
Paris Region wants to have a web application to track the investments it makes for its high schools buildings. They provided you the dataset.json files containing the existing investments.

# Stage 1: REST API

This is the heart of the test and is designed to allow you to be able to give us a good glimpse of your abilities.
We are looking for a Python developer that is able to step up as the platform architect as the projects are adopted by the various groups within the company.

For the backend, we would like you to write REST APIs to retrieve the investment data:

 - List all the investments
 - Return lists filtered by town, status or spelling.
 - Delete, add and modify investments
 - Get a single investment by id

Pay attention to the HTTP methods and status codes you use!

The preference is for Python Django or Fast API. Database-wise, PostGreSQL is the preference, but maybe you have strong arguments as to why other approaches would be preferable ? Let us know.

# Stage 2: The Web application

This test is oriented towards backend development. However, some basic proficiency in frontend development is necessary.

In this case, we would like you to develop a simple web application. For the frontend we would love you to be able to show us exactly what you can do, so feel free to use your preferred technology. Note however, that we are planning to build the app with Angular, so bonus points if you are able to write the frontend with Angular!

Via your app, we would like you to:

 - Display the list of investments in the form of a table (raw HTML or a 3rd party library that lets you apply various filters, right-clicks, drag-and-drop...)
 - Add a form so that we can trigger the API filters
 - Add a page to show and to modify the details of a single investment

Although this test if aimed togethers backend developers, feel free to show off your skills by imagining and adding some interesting graphs / maps to spice up your website!

## Bonus stages
The following are not obligatory but would be excellent to see!

 - Deploy your application to a cloud platform of your choice
 - Have some cool ideas? Go for it üëç

# Modalities
Create a repository on GitHub to store your source code and send us the link by e-mail once you've finished
Please provide a README with instructions to run your project

Once we've had a good look at your web app we will get together and discuss the results.
