# Exxact Robotics - Backend Python Developer Test üõ†
Hi! We're glad you want to join Exxact Robotics! We've designed this test so that you can show us how you think about a problem and how you implement its solution. We'll discuss about it during our next meeting.

# Project
Paris Region wants to have a web application to track the investments it makes for its high schools buildings. They provided you the dataset.json files containing the existing investments.

# Stage 1: REST API
Write a REST API to retrieve the investments data:

List all the investments
List investments filtered by ville and/or by etat_d_avancement
Get a single investment by id
Pay attention to the HTTP methods and status codes you use.

# Stage 2: Web application
Implement a simple web application to show the investments:

Display the list of investments in the form of a table
Add a form so that we can trigger the API filters
Add a page to show the details of a single investment
Bonus stages
Those are not required but can be cool to do!

Add an endpoint to edit an investment
Deploy your application to Heroku
Display some graphs or interesting figures in the web application
Have some cool idea? Go on üëç

# Modalities
You are free to use the languages and tools you are more comfortable with
Create a repository on GitHub to store your source code and send us the link by e-mail once you've finished
Please provide a README with instructions to run your project
